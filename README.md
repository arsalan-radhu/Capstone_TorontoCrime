## Overview
This GitHub repository hosts the code and documentation for a data science capstone project focused on analyzing the crime rates in different neighborhoods in Toronto over the years. This project is an extension of the initial "Areas of Interest Submission" and aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the crime problem in Toronto, its impact on various communities, and a proposed data science solution.

## Problem Area
Crime is a critical concern for any city, and Toronto is no exception. Understanding crime trends, patterns, and their distribution across neighborhoods is crucial for policymakers, law enforcement, and the general public. This project's primary focus is to analyze and visualize crime data to identify areas with high crime rates and assess their changes over time. We aim to provide actionable insights to address this problem effectively.

## Those Affected
The impact of crime extends to everyone in a community. The insights generated from this project will be beneficial for various stakeholders:

<b>Policymakers</b>: To allocate resources, improve law enforcement, and implement community programs effectively.</br>
<b>Law Enforcement</b>: To strategically deploy resources and personnel to areas with high crime rates.</br>
<b>Residents</b>: To be aware of crime trends in their neighborhoods and take precautionary measures.</br>
<b>Businesses</b>: To make informed decisions about where to establish or expand their operations.</br>

<b><i>Proposed Data Science Solution</i></b></br>
Our approach to solving this problem is based on data science techniques. We will perform data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling to gain insights into the following:
<ul>
    <li>Identifying neighborhoods with the highest and lowest crime rates.</li>
    <li>Analyzing temporal trends in crime data over the years.</li>
    <li>Predicting future crime rates in different areas.</li>
    <li>Evaluating the effectiveness of various law enforcement initiatives.</li>
    <li>This information will be used to suggest evidence-based strategies for reducing crime in high-risk areas.</li>
</ul>

## Impact of the Solution
The impact of this solution can be summarized as follows:

<b>Improved Safety</b>: By identifying high-crime areas, law enforcement can focus their efforts and resources more effectively, leading to reduced crime rates.</br>
<b>Informed Decision-Making</b>: Policymakers and community leaders can make data-driven decisions to implement preventive measures and allocate resources efficiently.</br>
<b>Aware Communities</b>: Residents and businesses in Toronto will have a better understanding of the crime landscape in their areas and can take proactive measures to enhance their safety.</br>

## Dataset
For this project, we will utilize the "Toronto Crime Data" dataset, which comprises crime reports collected over several years, categorized by crime type, location, and date. The dataset is publicly available and can be accessed through https://data.torontopolice.on.ca/pages/asr-open-data. Each crime was a different data sets which ahve been combined into one data set. It contains the following key attributes:
